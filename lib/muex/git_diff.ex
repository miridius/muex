defmodule Muex.GitDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  Maps a git diff to the set of source lines a change touched, so mutation
  testing can be scoped to exactly what a branch/PR modified.

  `changed_lines/1` is a pure parser over `git diff --unified=0` output;
  `changed_since/2` and `changed_staged/1` shell out to `git` and feed it that
  parser.

  @doc """
  Parses `git diff --unified=0` output into `%{path => MapSet of line numbers}`.

  Only added/modified lines on the new-file side are recorded. Deleted files and
  pure-deletion hunks contribute nothing.

  Returns the lines changed relative to `ref`, keyed by absolute path.

  Uses `git diff --unified=0 --relative --merge-base <ref>` in `:cd` (default:
  the current directory): the working tree against the point where the branch
  diverged from `ref` (PR semantics). The working tree, not `HEAD`, is what
  gets mutated, so uncommitted edits are included and the line numbers match
  the files on disk; on a clean tree this is the same as `<ref>...HEAD`.
  `--relative` names files from `:cd` rather than from the top of the
  repository, so a project that lives in a subdirectory of its repository still
  finds its own files. Returns `{:ok, map}` or `{:error, reason}`.

  @doc """
  Returns the lines staged in git's index, keyed by absolute path.

  Uses `git diff --cached --unified=0 --relative` in `:cd` (default: the
  current directory). git runs with this process's environment, so a
  `GIT_INDEX_FILE` set by a pre-commit hook is honoured: during
  `git commit -a` or `git commit <paths>`, git points hooks at a temporary
  index, and that index is what will be committed. Returns `{:ok, map}` or
  `{:error, reason}`.

  Keeps only the mutations whose location falls on a changed line.

  `changed` is a map as returned by `changed_since/2` or `changed_staged/1`, or
  `nil` to disable filtering (returns every mutation unchanged). A mutation's
  file is expanded before the lookup, so a location loaded as `lib/foo.ex`
  matches the absolute path the diff names.
