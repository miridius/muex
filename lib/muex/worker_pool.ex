defmodule Muex.WorkerPool do
  @moduledoc """
  Manages a pool of workers for parallel mutation testing across all files.

  Uses a global queue of mutations. Each worker operates in an isolated
  sandbox directory, with its own copy of the mutated file and its own build
  of that file's app, so that parallel `mix test` invocations don't see each
  other's mutations.

  ## Scheduling strategy

  When a worker slot becomes available, the pool picks the next mutation
  from the file with the most pending mutations. Mutations run in parallel
  whether they target different files or the same one.
